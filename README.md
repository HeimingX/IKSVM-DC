# IKSVM-DC

# Introduction

This package implements a novel indefinite kernel SVM algorithm named IKSVM-DC. The algorithm IKSVM-DC is specially designed for the primal form of indefinite kernel SVM problem. Further details about IKSVM-DC can be found in the following [paper](http://cse.seu.edu.cn/people/hxue/papers/Solving%20indefinite%20kernel%20support%20vector%20machine%20with%20difference%20of%20convex%20functions%20programming.pdf):

# Requirements

- Matlab, version 2014a and higher.
- The package is mostly self-contain. 
Several functions require the Optimization Toolbox, e.g., CVX toolbox or Mosek toolbox.

# Installation

- Create a directory of your choice and copy the toolbox there.
- Set the path in your Matlab to add the directory you just created.

# How to start?

To help you start working with indefinite kernel SVM, we provide a demo(See demo.m) in this package. 
You can follow the procedure as described in the demo.
